about: Create a bug report to help us improve workflowr
---

Before reporting your bug, please search the existing issues (both "open" and "closed") to check that a similar bug has not already been reported.

1. Give the exact command or line of code you ran that caused the issue, e.g., `wflow_publish("myanalysis.Rmd")`.

2. Describe the result of running the command or code, including any warning or error messages.

3. Tell us about your computing environment, including the version of R, RStudio and workflowr you are using. The simplest way to do this is to run `sessionInfo()` in R (and `RStudio.Version()` if you are using RStudio) and copy the output here.
